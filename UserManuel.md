# User Manuel

The User Manual can be defined as a document consisting of pictures, photographs and explanatory texts prepared to provide the user with the necessary information such as technical specifications and operating information about the product so that the product can be used correctly and safely. User manuals are considered as a natural part of the product and complementary to the product, as they are the documents that convey the transportation, assembly and operating information about the product to the user. User manuals have an important place in Turkish national legislation. The Regulation on the Implementation Principles of the Warranty Certificate published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which started with the Consumer Protection Law No. 4077, amended by the Law No. 4822; The Regulation on After-Sales Services of Industrial Goods and the Regulations on Promotion and Implementation Principles of User Manuals, and the ongoing series of laws and regulations, govern how the User Manuals should be arranged and mandatory.

In addition, TSE made a separate study on this subject and prepared a standard called TS 11823:1995 Introduction and User Guide Rules. Despite this, in Turkish Industry in general, except for a part of the white goods and machinery sector, the work of preparing user manuals is not done sufficiently. With the publication of the Framework Law No. 4703, it is a legal obligation for products that are within the scope of EU New Approach Directives or not to be placed on the market, to be safe. It is a very common opinion that ensuring product safety is not possible without a properly prepared user manual. For this reason, EU New Approach Directives emphasize that User Manuals should be given with the product as a complement to the product, and it is thought that a well-designed and prepared user manual indicates an adequate “technical dossier”. Therefore, the preparation of a well-designed user manual that meets the demands of laws and regulations for every product introduced to the market, whether within the scope of the EU New Approach Directives or not, should be considered as a part of the product design.
